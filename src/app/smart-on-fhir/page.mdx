# SMART on FHIR

At Tiro.health, we encourage healthcare organizations to host their own FHIR server, ensuring patient data remains securely stored within hospital infrastructure. Integration with these systems is achieved through SMART on FHIR - a standardized HL7 protocol built on widely-adopted web standards like OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

SMART on FHIR extends these foundations with healthcare-specific capabilities:

1. Standardized authorization scopes for healthcare data access
2. Exchange of clinical context (patient and encounter information)
3. Seamless integration with FHIR servers

This creates a comprehensive protocol that handles both authentication and clinical data exchange in a secure, standards-based way.
