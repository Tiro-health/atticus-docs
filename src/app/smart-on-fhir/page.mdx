# SMART on FHIR

The SMART on FHIR protocol brings three things:

1. Exchange of identity when launching the app
2. Exchange of context (eg. patient ID, encounter ID)
2. Authorization to the FHIR server

This way the workflow integration and data integration is seamlessly handled by a single protocol.
