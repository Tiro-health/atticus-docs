# Tips for working with FHIR in Atticus

This page contains tips and best practices for working with FHIR resources in Atticus to help you get the most out of the platform.

## Store your internal identifiers in FHIR resources

When creating resources in Atticus, you want to use your internal identifiers to retrieve them.

For example, you might want to use your hospital's patient ID to retrieve a patient resource. To do this, you can store your internal identifiers in the `identifier` property of the FHIR resource. This property is an array of `Identifier` objects that can be used to store your internal identifiers.

### Identifier properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="system" type="uri" required>
    A URI that identifies the system that the identifier comes from. It servers
    as a namespace for the `value` property.
  </Property>
  <Property name="value" type="string" required>
    The actual identifier value. This value should be unique within the system
    that the `system` property points to.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Example of an `Identifier` object


### Important rules

- The `system` property must be a [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#syntax).
- The **domain** of the `system` should **be owned by your organization** or your organization's IT provider.
- The `value` property should be unique within the system. For example, if the `system` property points to your hospital's patient ID system, the `value` should be unique for each patient in your hospital.

### Usage in headers and query parameters

When using identifiers in headers or query parameters, you need to combine the `system` and the `value` of the identifier in a single string. The convention is to concatenate the `system` and the `value` with a pipe `|`. For example, if the `system` is `http://myhospital.org/patient-id` and the `value` is `12345`, the combined identifier would be `http://myhospital.org/patient-id|12345`.
This convention is used when [identifying users in authenticated requests](/fhir/authentication#end-user-identification-in-machine-to-machine-communication) and when performing [conditional operations on resources](./Patient#conditionally-update-a-patient).
