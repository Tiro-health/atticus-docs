# Practitioner

Practitioners are an essential part of Atticus. On this page, we'll dive into the different practitioner endpoints you can use to manage practitioners programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete practitioners. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The Practitioner model

The Practitioner model contains all the basic information about a healthcare practitioner, including their name, identifiers, and qualifications.

### Properties

The Practitioner model conforms to the FHIR Practitioner resource. The following properties are available:

<Properties>
  <Property name="resourceType" type="'Practitioner'" required>
      The FHIR resource type. This must be set to `'Practitioner'`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="name" type="HumanName[]" href='https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/practitioner-definitions.html#Practitioner.name'>
      The name of the practitioner. This includes given names and family name. Name contains an array of FHIR [`HumanName`](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/datatypes.html#humanname) objects.
  </Property>
  <Property name="name" type="ContactPoint[]" href='https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/practitioner-definitions.html#Practitioner.telecom'>
      The contact details of the practitioner. Telecom contains an array of FHIR [`ContactPoint`](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/datatypes.html#ContactPoint) objects.
