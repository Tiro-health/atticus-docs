# Encounter

Encounters are an essential part of Atticus. On this page, we’ll dive into the different encounter endpoints you can use to manage encounters programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete encounters. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The Encounter model

The Encounter model contains all the information about the encounters of a patient. In addition, encounters can also be group-based with more than one contact, they can have a pinned message, and they can be muted.

### Properties

The Encounter model conforms to the FHIR Encounter resource. The following properties are supported:

<Properties>
  <Property name="resourceType" type="'Encounter'" required>
      The FHIR resource type. This must be set to `'Encounter'`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="status" type="code" required href='https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.status'>
    The status of the encounter. Possible values are:
    - `planned`
    - `arrived`
    - `triaged`
    - `in-progress` (most common)
    - `onleave`
    - `finished`
    - `cancelled`
    - `entered-in-error`

    Atticus ignores status values but they are required by the FHIR standard.
  </Property>
  <Property name="identifier" type="Identifier[]" href='https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.identifier'>
      An array of [`Identifier`](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/datatypes.html#identifier) objects for this Encounter (e.g. MRN, SSN). This is the place to store EHR identifiers or hospital identifiers for the patient.
      More information about identifiers in Atticus can be found [here](./tips#linking-resources-to-your-internal-identifiers).
  </Property>
  <Property name="subject" type="Reference" required href='https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.subject'>
      A FHIR [`Reference`](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.subject) object pointing to the patient which is the subject of the encounter.
  </Property>
</Properties>
