# Microsoft Entra ID Integration

This guide explains how to integrate your Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with Tiro Health to enable secure access for your organization.

## Overview

Integrating Tiro Health with Microsoft Entra ID allows your users to access Tiro Health using their existing Microsoft credentials, simplifying user management and enhancing security through single sign-on capabilities.

## Integration Steps

2. Sign in with your administrator credentials
3. Review the requested permissions
4. Click "Accept" to grant Tiro Health access to identity information of your users

### Step 2: Provide Your Tenant ID

After granting admin consent, you need to provide your Microsoft Entra tenant ID to Tiro Health:

1. Send an email to [admin@tiro.health](mailto:admin@tiro.health) with the following information:
   - Subject: "Entra ID Integration - [Your Organization Name]"
   - Body: Include your Microsoft Entra tenant ID
   - Contact information for the technical point of contact

### Step 3: Confirmation

Once your tenant ID is configured in our system, you will receive a confirmation email. Your users will then be able to sign in to Tiro Health using their Microsoft credentials.
