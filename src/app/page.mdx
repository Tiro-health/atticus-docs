# Atticus Integration Documentation

Use the Atticus API to create structured reporting forms, populate them with your data, and extract FHIR resources from form responses. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Integration flow
Here's how a typical integration with Atticus works:

1. **Data Exchange**:
Atticus requires minimal patient data to associate with the QuestionnaireResponse. At minimum, a patient resource with a single identifier is required. You can optionally provide an encounter resource as well.
Learn more about available APIs in the [Atticus FHIR API](./fhir) section.

2. **Context Launch**
To provide a seamless user experience between your system and Atticus, we support contextual launches. This allows users to be redirected directly to a specific patient's information. The context launch flow is a two step process:
- Authorize a new session: A healthcare information systems (eg. EHR or LIS) authorizes a new session with the Atticus Authorization Server.
- Launch of Atticus: The user is redirected to the Atticus application in a new browser window.

Most native applications can configure an embedded browser, allowing the authenticated session to be created in the background. Once established, users are redirected to the Atticus form.\
When using a separate browser, external identity providers are required for authentication. SMART on FHIR enables exchange of both user identity and context.
Standard identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID or Google are also supported, though they cannot exchange context information.
More info about this can be found on the [context launch](./context) page and the [identiy provider](./identity-provider) page.

3. **Submission**:
The Atticus API lets external systems configure destinations for submitted data.
When a user submits a form, their QuestionnaireResponse data is sent to Atticus and forwarded to the configured endpoints.
