# Tiro.health Integration Docs

Welcome to the Tiro.health Integration docs! This documentation is designed to help you integrate Tiro.health Capture into your healthcare information system, such as an EHR or LIS. Whether you are a developer or an application manager, this documentation will guide you through the integration process.{{ className: 'lead' }}

### How should I integrate? Form SDK vs API?
Tiro.health offers two main ways to integrate with your healthcare information system:

| Audience | Type | Description |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| EHR or LIS-developers | [**Form SDK**](./form-sdk) | A UI package and and a docker images to integrate Tiro.health into your EHR or LIS.<br/> It provides a seamless user experience and allows you to leverage the full power of Tiro.health's technology. Developers stay in control of the patient data flow. They can use backend api's for form processing tasks like text narrative generation or validation.|
| EHR application managers | [**API**](./api) | A set of APIs to integrate Tiro.health Capture into your EHR or LIS.<br/>This is a more flexible way to integrate Tiro.health into your system, but it requires more work to set up and maintain. This integration is recommended for EHR or LIS systems that support a simple URL based integration. It allows you to quickly set up Tiro.health without being dependent on software development. However, it does not provide the same level of control over the data flow as the Form SDK. |
