# Atticus Integration Documentation

Use the Atticus API to instantiate new structured reporting forms, populate them with your data and extract FHIR resources from the form responses. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Integration flow
A typical integration flow with Atticus looks like this:

1. **Data Exchange**: Send data to Atticus
Atticus needs some minimal context to associate with the QuestionnaireResponse. At least a patient resource is required.
Often a empty patient resources with a single identifier is sufficient. Optionally an encounter resource can also be provided.

2. **Authentication**
Users need a seemless experience from your system to Atticus and back. To achieve this, a authenticated session is created.
This flow is different for native applications like .NET or Java applications from web applications.
\
\
Most native applications are able to configure a embedded browser. In this case, the authenticated session can be created in the background. Once a browser session is created, the user can be redirected to the Atticus form.\
When using a separate browser, external identity providers are needed. SMART on FHIR can be used to exchange both the user identity and context.
Classic Identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID or Google are also supported but are not able to exchange the context.

3. **Submission**: Submit the form
When the user submits the form, a QuestionnaireResponse with the answered data is sent to Atticus.
Depending on the configured tasks, Atticus will process the QuestionnaireResponse and return the results to the configured endpoints.
