# Getting started with the Tiro.health Form SDK

This guide covers the technical setup for accessing and configuring the Tiro.health Form SDK packages. For a broader overview of the Form SDK architecture and components, see the [introduction page](/).

Going through this guide is the quickest way to get started with the Tiro.health Form SDK, allowing you to integrate structured data capture capabilities into your healthcare information system and should only take 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

In order to gain access to the Tiro.health Form SDK packages, you'll need a dedicated Tiro.health service account and a service account key. This key will provide access for your local `docker` and `npm` clients to the Tiro.health registry.

If you don't have a service account yet, please contact your Tiro.health representative or email us at [support@tiro.health](mailto:support@tiro.health?subject=Service%20account%20request) to request one.

## Configure your docker environment to use the Tiro.health registry

Once you have your service account key JSON file, you'll need to configure Docker to authenticate with the Tiro.health registry.

### 1. Authenticate Docker with Google Cloud Artifact Registry

First, use the service account key to authenticate Docker:

```bash
# Use the service account key to authenticate Docker
cat path/to/your/service-account-key.json | docker login -u _json_key --password-stdin https://europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev
```

Replace `path/to/your/service-account-key.json` with the actual path to your service account key file.

### 2. Verify Docker authentication

Test that Docker can access the Tiro.health registry:

```bash
# Test access to the registry
docker pull europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/tiro-health/docker-ext/form-sdk-backend:latest
```

If authentication is successful, Docker will be able to pull images from the Tiro.health registry.

## Configure your npm environment to use the Tiro.health registry

To access Tiro.health's private npm packages, you'll need to configure npm to use your service account key for authentication.

### 1. Configure npm registry authentication

Create or update your `.npmrc` file to include the Tiro.health registry configuration:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory or home directory
cd your-project-directory

# Create or edit .npmrc file
echo "@tiro-health:registry=https://npm.pkg.dev/tiro-health/npm-ext/" >> .npmrc
echo "//npm.pkg.dev/tiro-health/npm-ext/:_authToken=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)" >> .npmrc
```

### 2. Authenticate with Google Cloud

First, authenticate using your service account key:

```bash
# Authenticate using the service account key
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=path/to/your/service-account-key.json

# Set your project (replace with actual Tiro.health project ID)
gcloud config set project tiro-health
```

### 3. Alternative: Use service account key directly

If you prefer not to use gcloud CLI, you can configure npm authentication directly:

```bash
# Generate base64 encoded credentials
echo "_json_key:$(cat path/to/your/service-account-key.json | base64 -w 0)" | base64 -w 0
```

Then add the result to your `.npmrc`:

```
@tiro-health:registry=https://npm.pkg.dev/tiro-health/npm-ext/
//npm.pkg.dev/tiro-health/npm-ext/:_authToken=<base64-encoded-credentials>
```

### 4. Verify npm authentication

Test that npm can access the Tiro.health packages:

```bash
# Search for Tiro.health packages
npm search @tiro-health

# Or try to install a specific package
npm install @tiro-health/form-sdk
```

## Start with our demo repository

Once you have both Docker and npm configured, you can get started with a complete demo setup that showcases the Tiro.health Toolkit integration.

### 1. Clone the demo repository

```bash
# Clone the Tiro.health demo repository
git clone https://github.com/tiro-health/form-sdk-demo.git
cd form-sdk-demo
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your service account details
# TIRO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json
# TIRO_PROJECT_ID=your-tiro-health-project-id
```

### 3. Install dependencies and start the demo

```bash
# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start the Docker containers
docker-compose up -d

# Run the demo application
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the demo

Once everything is running, you can access:

- **Demo Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:3000/api/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Docker authentication errors**: Verify your service account key has the necessary permissions for the Artifact Registry
2. **npm package not found**: Ensure your `.npmrc` is configured correctly and the service account has Artifact Registry Reader permissions
3. **Demo won't start**: Check that all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file
