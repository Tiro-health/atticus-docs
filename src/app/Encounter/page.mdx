# Encounter

Encounters are an essential part of Atticus. On this page, we’ll dive into the different encounter endpoints you can use to manage encounters programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete encounters. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The Encounter model

The Encounter model contains all the information about the encounters of a patient. In addition, encounters can also be group-based with more than one contact, they can have a pinned message, and they can be muted.

### Properties

The Encounter model conforms to the FHIR Encounter resource. The following properties are available:

<Properties>
  <Property name="resourceType" type="'Encounter'" required>
      The FHIR resource type. This must be set to `'Encounter'`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="status" type="enum" required href='https://hl7.org/fhir/encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.status'>
        The status of the encounter. Possible values are:
        - `planned`
        - `arrived`
        - `triaged`
        - `in-progress` (most common)
        - `onleave`
        - `finished`
        - `cancelled`
        - `entered-in-error`
  </Property>
  <Property name="subject" type="Reference" required href='https://hl7.org/fhir/encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.subject'>
      A FHIR Reference to the patient that is the subject of the encounter.
  </Property>
</Properties>
