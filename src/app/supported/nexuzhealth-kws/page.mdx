# Nexuzhealth KWS

## UI Integration

The UI integration that enables a seamless launch for Practitioners is based on the 'External Web Viewer' API. Contact Tiro.health for more information


## Data Integration

1. The human-readable report can be send back using a 'process response' Task. Tiro.health makes use of the KWS Import XML API to send back the report. Hospitals should obtain a unique 'application identifier' from Nexuzhealth and expose a public endpoint to send back. Tiro.health supports more complex network setups like VPN, static IP's or mutual TLS on-demand.

2. Currently Nexuzhealth KWS has no documented support for structured FHIR resources like QuestionnaireResponses, Conditions and Procedures. Tiro.health allows hospitals to archive these resources in a structured format in secondary systems like data warehouses or secured network drives.
