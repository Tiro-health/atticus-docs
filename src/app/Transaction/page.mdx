# Transactions

Combining multiple operations in a single transaction can be useful when you need to ensure that all operations succeed or fail together. This page explains how to use FHIR transactions in Atticus. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The Bundle Resource

A FHIR Bundle is a container for a collection of resources. When used for transactions, the Bundle contains a list of operations (create, update, delete) that should be processed atomically - meaning either all operations succeed or none of them do.

### Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="resourceType" type="'Bundle'" required>
    The FHIR resource type. This must be set to `'Bundle'`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="type" type="code" required>
    For transactions, this must be set to `'transaction'`.
  </Property>
  <Property name="entry" type="array" required>
    An array of entry objects, each containing a request and a resource.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Making Transaction Requests {{ tag: 'POST', label: '/' }}

<Row>
  <Col>
    This endpoint allows you to submit a transaction Bundle containing multiple operations. The following example shows how to create a Patient and an associated Encounter in a single transaction.

    ### Request Structure
    Each entry in the Bundle must specify:
    - The HTTP method (`POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`)
    - The relative URL for the resource
    - The resource data (except for DELETE operations)

    ### Transaction Processing
    - All operations in the Bundle are processed as a single transaction
    - If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back
    - Operations are processed in the order they appear in the Bundle
    - References between resources in the Bundle can use temporary IDs

## Transaction Rules

- All resources in a transaction must have a `request` element specifying the HTTP method and URL
- For resources being created (POST), you can provide a temporary UUID in the `fullUrl` field to allow other resources in the bundle to reference it
- The server processes the transaction atomically - either all operations succeed or none do
- If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back and an OperationOutcome is returned
- References between resources in the transaction can use the temporary UUIDs specified in `fullUrl`

## Common Use Cases

- Creating a patient and their initial encounter together
- Updating multiple related resources at once
- Deleting a group of related resources
- Ensuring referential integrity between resources

## Error Handling

If any operation in the transaction fails, the server will return an OperationOutcome resource describing the error. No changes will be committed to the database in case of failure.

```json
{
  "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
  "issue": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": "processing",
      "diagnostics": "Transaction failed: Invalid resource in entry[0]"
    }
  ]
}
```
```

This documentation page provides a comprehensive overview of FHIR transactions, including:
- Explanation of the Bundle resource and its properties
- Detailed example of creating multiple related resources in a transaction
- Code examples in both cURL and C#
- Transaction rules and processing behavior
- Common use cases
- Error handling

The examples show how to create a Patient and an associated Encounter in a single transaction, demonstrating how to use temporary UUIDs for references between resources in the bundle.
