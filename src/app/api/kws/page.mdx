# Nexuzhealth KWS

Integrating Tiro.health with Nexuzhealth KWS allows healthcare providers to launch Tiro.health for a selected patient/encounter directly from KWS and save the resulting report back into the KWS system. This integration streamlines workflows and ensures patient data is centralized.

An integration typically has three parts:

- A **context launch** launch from an **External Viewer** in KWS that allows users to launch Tiro.health inside the KWS application. This launch is handled by a **MIRTH channel** that intercepts the URL and redirects the user to Tiro.health with the necessary patient and encounter context.

- A **report export** using a MIRTH channel that exports the completed report back to KWS, ensuring that the report is stored in the patient's record. This **MIRTH channel** makes use of the KWS Import XML API to send the report back to KWS.

- A [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra-id) integration that allows users to authenticate with Tiro.health using their existing hospital credentials. This provides a seamless user experience and ensures that user data is securely managed.

{/**
- A data import phase, where data is retrieved from a source system and loaded into Atticus. The data is mostly metadata about the patient, the current encounter and the report that must be completed.
- A context launch phase, where a user opens the application on a specific patient and encounter. This is typically done by integrating a parametrized URL into the source system, which opens Atticus in the context of the patient and encounter.
- A data export phase, where data is sent back to the source system after the user has completed the report in Atticus. This is typically done by sending a FHIR QuestionnaireResponse resource back to the source system.

## Context Launch

To facilitate the import of context data and enable the launch of Tiro.health, the following [MIRTH channel](https://github.com/Tiro-health/atticus-mirth/tree/main/channels/import/URL) is utilized. This channel intercepts a specific URL opened by the KWS External Viewer and redirects the user to Tiro.health.

### Configuration

The KWS External Viewer API needs to be configured as follows:

- **Base URL:** The default base URL is `http://localhost/launch`. It's crucial that this URL matches the domain where the MIRTH server is running and that the path aligns with the MIRTH source listener configuration.

  **Important:** Since the URL transmits patient data, ensure the MIRTH channel is secured within your intranet or encrypted with TLS to protect sensitive information.

- **Parameters:** The following URL parameters are used to pass patient and encounter data from KWS to Tiro.health:

| **URL Parameter** | **KWS Value**              | **Optional / Required** |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `patient`         | `patient.eadnr`            | Required                |
| `encounter`       | `contact.cnr`              | Required                |
| `supervisor`      | `contact.supervisor.login` | Optional                |
| `user`            | `user.login`               | Optional                |
| `dob`             | `patient.birthDate`        | Optional                |
| `sex`             | `patient.gender`           | Optional                |

**Note:** The mapping of these parameters is fully customizable within the MIRTH source transformer.

**Example of a final URL:**

`http://localhost/launch/?encounter=test-cnr3&dob=1941-12-12&sex=male&patient=test-ead3&supervisor=andrieskwslogin`

With this setup, users can select a contact in KWS and launch directly to app.tiro.health.

## Report Export

After a report is submitted in Tiro.health, it needs to be exported back to KWS. This is handled by two interconnected MIRTH channels:

1.  The [first MIRTH channel](https://github.com/Tiro-health/atticus-mirth/tree/main/channels/export/PollForQRs) periodically checks for newly submitted reports.
2.  Once a new report is detected, it is redirected to the [second MIRTH channel](https://github.com/Tiro-health/atticus-mirth/tree/main/channels/export/FHIRBundleToKWS), which then sends the report to KWS using the KWS Import XML API.

Hospitals will need to obtain a unique **'application identifier'** from Nexuzhealth for this export process.

Currently, only the plaintext human-readable report can be stored in KWS. Nexuzhealth KWS has no documented support for structured FHIR resources like QuestionnaireResponses, Conditions and Procedures. Tiro.health allows hospitals to archive these resources in a structured format in secondary systems like data warehouses or secured network drives. For more information, contact support@tiro.health.
