# Tiro.health API Integrations
Tiro.health provides a set of APIs to integrate structured data capture capabilities into your healthcare information system, such as an EHR or LIS.{{ className: 'lead' }}

The API integration allow you to leverage Tiro.health's technology for structured data capture without needing to implement a full UI integration. This is particularly useful for EHR or LIS systems that support a simple URL-based integration, allowing you to quickly set up Tiro.health.


## Supported Integrations
The Tiro.health platform supports a variety of EHR integrations through standardized FHIR APIs.
Overview of supported integrations:

1. **KWS by Nexuzhealth**: [Learn more](./api/kws) about the KWS integration.
2. **Synops by AZ Maria Middelares**: Tiro.health is deeply integrated in Synops. Please contact the application manager of your hospital for more information.
3. **HiX by ChipSoft**: [Contact us](mailto:support@tiro.health?subject=HiX%20integration%20request) for more information on the HiX integration.
4. **Primuz**: [Contact us](mailto:support@tiro.health?subject=Primuz%20integration%20request) for more information on the Primuz integration.

## High-level Integration Flow
Here's how a typical integration with Tiro.health API looks like:

1. **Data Exchange**:
Atticus requires minimal patient data to associate with the QuestionnaireResponse. At minimum, a patient resource with a single identifier is required. You can optionally provide an encounter resource as well. This data can be imported in your data tenant in the background before users are writing structured report to prevent users from having to enter patient data manually.\
Learn more about available APIs in the [Atticus FHIR API](./fhir) section.

2. **Context Launch**
To provide a seamless user experience between your system and Atticus, we support contextual launches. This allows users to be redirected directly to a specific patient's information. The context launch flow is a two step process:
- Authorize a new session: A healthcare information systems (eg. EHR or LIS) authorizes a new session with the Atticus Authorization Server.
- Launch of Atticus: The user is redirected to the Atticus application in a new browser window.

Most native applications can configure an embedded browser, allowing the authenticated session to be created in the background. Once established, users are redirected to the Atticus form.\
When using a separate browser, external identity providers are required for authentication. SMART on FHIR enables exchange of both user identity and context.
Standard identity providers like Microsoft Entra ID or Google are also supported, though they cannot exchange context information.
More info about this can be found on the [context launch](./context) page and the [identiy provider](./identity-provider) page.

3. **Submission**:
The Atticus API lets external systems configure destinations for submitted data.
When a user submits a form, their QuestionnaireResponse data is sent to Atticus and forwarded to the configured endpoints.
