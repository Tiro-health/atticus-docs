# Atticus Docs

## Getting started

To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.
## Update the docs
All docs are written in MDX which is a combination of Markdown and JSX. You can find the individual pages in the `src/app` directory.

### Navigation
The navigation structure is defined as a Javascript array called `navigation` in the [src/components/Navigation.tsx](src/components/Navigations/tsx) file.
Make sure the `href` matches a folder in the `src/app` directory.

### Documentation pages
All documentation pages are written in MDX and can be found in the `src/app` directory. Each page should have a `metadata` object at the top of the file that defines the title and description of the page. The `sections` array should list all the sections on the page.
The directory where the page is located is used as the URL path. For example, a page in `src/app/docs/api` will be available at `/docs/api`.

## Customizing
Customization of the design and functionality is possible by modifying the React components in the `src/components` directory.

## Global search

This template includes a global search that's powered by the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) library. It's available by clicking the search input or by using the `âŒ˜K` shortcut.

This feature requires no configuration, and works out of the box by automatically scanning your documentation pages to build its index. You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `/src/mdx/search.mjs` file.
